    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 types are text, int, real and blob. Text is like a string, int is an integer, real is likea float or decimal, and blob is binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys are unique identifiers, containing only unique values for each entry. Foreign keys will be the related key (primary key)in another table, connecting them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "No clue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "By default, INNER join, where contents matched from both tables appear in data. \n",
    "LEFT join - all contents from original table appear in result, along with all data from second table that matches. Data unmatched in second table will show as null. \n",
    "\n",
    "RIGHT join is opposite. All contents from second table are returned, with only matching content from original table added, unmatching elements are null. \n",
    "\n",
    "LEFT join where B is null, joins all original table data, minus data from second table that matched original. \n",
    "\n",
    "RIGHT join where A is null is opposite, where all right table data is returned minus matching left table data. \n",
    "\n",
    "FULL OUTER join combines all data from both tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "FULL OUTER where left is null or right is null returns all data from both tables without data that didn't match\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions, like AVG, SUM, COUNT are used to get more complex value calculations from data entries. These are related to GROUP BY statements in that you can first use an aggregate function, and then able to group by to get your data grouped by a certain column or by the aggregate function of the data from that column. Useful for larger data sets where you can't simply tally up the entries into groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "No clue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
